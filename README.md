# Add N Points To A List Of Points
This is a visual project made in Unity3D + C#. This project has two scenes each of which add N points to a list of points (trajectory) read from a file.

- `Esferas Random`: Insert n points in random positions among the points of the trajectory.
- `Esferas Interpoladas`: Create a new trajectory by resampling the original trajectory.

To use the scenes, select the GameObject DibujanteDeEsferas from the Hierarchy, insert the number of points to add, and press add.
